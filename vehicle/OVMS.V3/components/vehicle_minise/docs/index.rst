Vehicle Type: **Mini Cooper SE**

This vehicle type supports the Mini Cooper SE. All model years should be supported.

The OVMS support was developed Nov 2022 from the BMW i3 module.

As of this release this vehicle support is read-only and cannot send commands to the car.

WARNINGS
--------

12V Battery drain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Mini Cooper SE has a small 20Ah AGM 12v battery. Whilst care has been taken to minimize OVMS' power usage,
OVMS could eventually drain this battery if the car is left unplugged and locked.
OVMS will also send an alert if 12V drops under 12V alert threshold. (See 12V Calibration section).

HOWEVER: If you are going to leave the car for a fews days, it is recommended to unplug OVMS.

----------
Car status
----------

The car is accessible over the OBD-II port when it is running (ignition on) and for a short time
(40 seconds or so) after it is turned off or the car is "tweaked" (lock button pushed,
connected-drive command received, etc).

Unfortunately this means that when your car is standing or charging OVMS only has
intermittent access to data from the car.  

By observation, whilst the car is charging it wakes up now and then (seems to be every 30 minutes).
So at those times we can update our SOC etc.

Metrics "v.e.awake" tells you if the car is awake or not.  Metric "xms.s.age" will tell you how
many minutes have passed since we last received data from the car.

You may also refer to metric xms.s.pollermode as follows:

==== ================================================
Mode Meaning
==== ================================================
 0   Car is asleep - no OBD-II data traffic
 1   Car OBD-II is awake - we are seeing data traffic
 2   Car is ready to drive or driving
 3   Car is charging

----------------
To be researched
----------------

Can we start/stop charging?

Can we pre-heat?

Can we lock/unlock the car?

Can we disable the OBD-II alarm

Still looking for the trip regen kWh

Can we get the voltage state of each individual cells rather than just the battery min / max / average?
